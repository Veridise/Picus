added:
  - Supported generating JSON output file simultaneously with
    the regular text outputting mode.
changed:
  - The previous `--json` command-line option is now equivalent to `--json -`.
  - Users must now set `--truncate` and `--log-level` explicitly for the `--json` mode.
  - The main Picus application is now under the `main` submodule.
    To invoke it programmatically, use `(submod ... main)`.
