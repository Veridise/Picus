added:
  - Added a testing library, so that we can run more
    benchmarks easily.
  - Uploaded generated JSON files as an archive on GHA
    so that we can perform an analysis on it later.

fixed:
  - Fixed the test runner so that it partitions work
    across threads correctly even when there's a test failure.
