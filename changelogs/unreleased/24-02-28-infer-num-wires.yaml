fixed:
  - Updated the sr1cs format to remove the `num-wires` clause.
    In particular, we can already infer this variable by
    walking through the whole circuit and find the maximum wire id.
    This particularly matters because we could have extra constraints
    that are not registered with the Gnark engine, so the reported
    `num-wires` could potentially be incorrect.
    But circuit walking will take these extra constriants into account.
