fixed:
  - Fixed the performance issue in linear lemma. Previously, we search over all clauses to
    remove known variables from the list, discover more known variables, and repeat this process
    until the fixpoint. The search over all clauses repeatedly could be very expensive,
    especially when there are only a few clauses to consider. This commit fixes the problem
    by building an inverse mapping from variable to it associated clauses directly,
    so there is no need to search over all clauses anymore. This speeds up
    the hydra benchmark from 200s to 4s.
